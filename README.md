# Linak Desk Application
This is desktop application controlling Linak office desks. Application functionality is 
similar to application provided by Linak. 
One of the goals of this project is to allow the desk control under Linux operating 
systems, because official application does not support Linux OS. 

Application was tested on *DPG1C* desk panel containing built-in Bluetooth module.

Communication protocol between *DPG1C* module and official application was
reverse engineered mostly by mocking *DPG1C* Bluetooth service.


## Features
- scanning for nearby devices
- moving up/down
- moving to favourite position
- setting reminder, desk offset and favoritie positions
- system tray icon
- auto reconnecting to recent device
- persisting application settings
- drawing position chart over time
- position statistics

## Requirements

Before first run there is few things to configure. All steps can be run by calling 
`configure_all.sh` script.

If the script fails for any reason then go through steps described in subsections below.


### Required libraries
- PyQt5
- matplotlib
- pandas
- bluepy

Installation:
- `sudo apt install python3-pyqt5`
- `pip3 install -r ./src/requirements.txt`

Following instructions can be executed once by script `./src/install_reqs.sh`


### Bluepy permissions

*Bluepy* package requires special privileges when scanning for nearby devices.
It is recomended to solve it by adding capabilities to the package:

`cd <PYTHON_PATH>/site-packages/bluepy`

`sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' bluepy-helper`

Go to directory where bluepy is installed (local user or system) and execute `setcap` as stated above.


### Git submodules

In addition, application requires additional submodule located in *lib* directory.
To fetch the module simply call *configure_submodules.sh* script placed in root directory tree.


## Running application

To run application try one of:
- run *src/linakdeskctl*
- run *src/linakdeskapp/main.py* 
- execute *cd src; python3 -m linakdeskapp*

Before first use make sure You have fetched *lib* submodule (see _Requirements_ section).

### Web server

Desk position can be operated through http GET requests. Before sending a requests 
the web server have to be started. It can be done by activating chekcbox from `WebServer`. 
Then `http://localhost:8000` will be accessible from web browser. Visit the web page for possible commands.


## Development

Project contains several tools and features that facilitate development and maintenance of the project.


### Static code check

In *tools* directory there can be found following scripts:
- *notrailingwhitespaces.sh* -- as name states removes trailing whitespaces from _*.py*_ files
- *rmpyc.sh* -- remove all _*.pyc_ files
- *codecheck.sh* -- static code check using *pycodestyle* and *flake8* against defined set of rules
- *doccheck.sh* -- run *pydocstyle* with defined configuration
- *checkall.sh* -- execute *codecheck.sh* and *doccheck.sh* at once


### Profiling

Application can be run in profiler mode passing *--profile* as command line parameter. 


### Running tests

To run tests execute *src/testlinakdeskapp/runtests.py*. It can be run with code profiling 
and code coverage options.

In addition there is demo application not requiring Bluetooth connection. It 
can be run by *testlinakdeskapp/gui/main_window_example.py*.


### Running mock service

To some extent there is possibility to test the application without physical device. *linakdeskmock* package was made
for this purpose.

To run mock simply execute *linakdeskmock/main.py* file.


### Analysing Bluetooth device

Directory *test/gatttool* contains several scripts providing information about near devices such as:
- near LE devices,
- services, characteristics and descriptors of desired device,
- basic characteristics of desired device (name, manufacturer, version etc),
- listening to desk notifications


### Reversing communication protocol

Some of dynamic properties of communication protocol of the desk was 
discovered by dedicated tool: [BluetoothGattMitm](https://github.com/anetczuk/BluetoothGattMitm).

The tool allows to intercept all BLE messages passed between the device and it's original Android application.


### Working with venv

There are two scripts that make it easy to work with *venv*:
- `tools/installvenv.sh`
- `tools/startvenv.sh`

They prepare and start virtual environment respectively.

In addition following package is required (installed from within venv):
- `pip3 install --user vext.pyqt5`

Moreover for unknown reason fixing *bluepy* permissions inside virtual environment can be ineffective leading
to problems with scanning for nearby bluetooth devices.

This problem can be worked arround by:
1. executing application with `sudo` (not recomended)
2. passing device's address by command-line argument `./src/linakdeskctl --connect {device_mac_address}`


## Examples of use of not obvious Python mechanisms:
- use of *EnumMeta* class (*linak_service.py*)
- defining method decorators (*synchronied.py*)
- use of threading: *Thread*, *Event*, *Timer*
- use of *QThreadPool* and *Worker* concepts
- properly killing (Ctrl+C) PyQt (*sigint.py*)
- loading of UI files and inheriting from it
- embedding matplotlib graph with navigation toolbar into PyQt widget
- code profiling (*cProfile*)
- code coverage (*coverage*)


## ToDo:
- handle cm/inch unit switch
- add fav buttons inside popup of system tray icon
- handle away from keyboard


## Issues:
- disabling light guidance does not seem to work. It seems to be problem on 
device side, because even in Linak app it does not work.


## Support

If You like the project or if it is valuable to You then feel free to support my work.
